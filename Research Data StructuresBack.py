#Research Data StructuresBack


#Research different types of Data Structures. 
#These Data Structures are used in many different programming languages, 
#so you don't need to find Python specific information, although it is suggested.

#Requirements for credit (all must be satisfied):
#Header with your name, date, CRN, and class name
#Research the following Data Structures:
#2D Array
#Linked List
#Stack
#Queue
#Dictionary / Hash Map
#Set
#For each Data Structure have 1-2 paragraphs summarizing:
#Define what it is (how is it different from the others)
#1 or more use cases (why would you use this data structure instead of the others)
#Each paragraph should be 3-5 sentences


#2D Array

#An array is a data structure that sources elements of the same data in sequential order. 
#Two-dimensional is also a data structure but in this case stores two indices instead of one. 
#An array of an array is represented in a table with rows and columns of data.
#It can be used for a table score in a tournament.

#Linked List
#The difference between a list and liked list is in how it stores the data in the memory. A linked list uses a part of the element as a reference, and a list uses a contiguous memory block.
#Advantages of this data structure are: the memory is allocated at run-time, insertion and deletion operations take less time. It can be used for example to implement queues.

#Stack

#Stack is a linear data structure with an order of how the operations are performed.
#Stack uses the order Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) manner to store items.
#The main difference from an array is that stacks can store elements of different types.
#Some examples of this data structure can be found in the Back/Forward stacks on browsers or, Undo/Redo stacks in Excel or Word.

#Queue

#Queue is also is a linear data structure similar to stack; with an order of how the operations are performed.
#Queue uses the order First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner to store items.
#As a difference with stack(all insertions are made at the same end), a queue is exactly the opposite because it is open at both ends; one for insert and the other to remove data.
#It can be used for example for a wait in DMV or customer service, multimedia playlist, or Starbucks orders. 

#Dictionary / Hash Map

#A dictionary is an unordered and mutable Python data structure that stores mappings of unique keys to values.
#Dictionaries use keys for indexing. They are an unordered sequence of items. The keys are immutable.
#An example could be just a dictionary.

#Set

#Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#A set is a collection of data unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.
#It cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element.
#An example of the use of sets is to remove duplicate elements from a sequence.
