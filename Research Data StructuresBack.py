#Research different types of Data Structures. 
# These Data Structures are used in many different programming languages, 
# so you don't need to find Python specific information, although it is suggested.

#For each Data Structure have 1-2 paragraphs summarizing:
#Define what it is (how is it different from the others)
#1 or more use cases (why would you use this data structure instead of the others)
